<h1>About</h1>

<section>
<p>My name is Apoorva (pronunciation: <i>Uh-poo-rvuh</i>), and I'm currently trying to convince everyone (including myself) that I'm pretty decent at this computer thingy. I'm currently mostly working on systems/perf-tools/graphics programming.</p>

<p>I was born in, and have spent most of my life in the mysterious subcontinent of India. I'm a second generation programmer, and hence have been fiddling with computers ever since I can remember.</p>

<p>I started out programming with BASIC, and as my first large project, ended up making a full-featured home-expense-tracking system for my mom when I was in the seventh grade. I learnt most of my early programming skills through books, because I got consistent internet access around 2006. The internet greatly accelerated my rate of learning, and I've worked on cooler stuff ever since. Here's an incomplete whirlwind history:</p>

<p>I created and shipped my <a href="http://socioballthegame.com/">first video game</a> while studying for my bachelor's degree, and also did some freelancing around that time. I was an intern at Microsoft, where I worked on search engine stuff. I worked at NVIDIA on developer tools for GPUs; it was here that I learnt CUDA and systems programming. In my free time, I work on projects like an <a href="https://github.com/ApoorvaJ/Papaya">image editor</a>, and various open-source libraries.</p>

<p>I enjoy working on visual problems and strive to pursue elegance and minimalism in the way I try to solve them. I started out as a C# &amp; Windows person, but am on my way to becoming a Unix fanboy, with plans to acquire a neckbeard and a lawn to shoo people off of.</p>

<p>Computing aside, I like to compose and perform poetry. I play the guitar, can fiddle around with the piano, and own a violin that I look at wistfully sometimes. I draw once in a while - maybe I'll put up some photos on the website some day. I also enjoy watching artsy cinema and reading a variety of books.</p>
