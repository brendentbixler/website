Do you use Linux? Do you need to SSH into remote or embedded devices? Do you
feel underproductive on the command-line? Do you want to pointlessly run htop
while doing basically no work, just to look cool and hacker-like? tmux is just
the tool for you.

# An intro to tmux

tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It allows you to have multiple terminal sessions
open in a single terminal window.

It is useful for ergonomics, since you can get a lot more done on the
command-line this way, without using your mouse and while keeping everything
important on screen.

It is also useful on remote or embedded systems since your session does not go
down even if the connection between your machine and the remote machine breaks.
tmux is implemented as a server, so it keeps running even if the connection
dies.

tmux's server-based design can be used as way of screen-sharing and
collaborating on the same shell session from anywhere in the world.

# About this post

This is not an in-depth comparison of GNU Screen and tmux. It's not even a list
of the comprehensive features of tmux.

This is a brain-dump documenting how I use tmux, and hopefully encouraging other
people to give it a shot. Your mileage may vary.

This blog post also contains a tmux-agnostic keyboard shortcut that can change
your life. I mean that.

# My tmux config

To configure tmux, create a file called `~/.tmux.conf`. Here's mine:

~~~
set -g status off
set -g mouse on
set -g set-clipboard off
bind -n WheelUpPane if-shell -F -t = "#{mouse_any_flag}" "send-keys -M; \
send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M" "if -Ft= '#{pane_in_mode}' 'send-keys -M; \
send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M' 'select-pane -t=; copy-mode -e; \
send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M'"
bind -n WheelDownPane if-shell -F -t = "#{mouse_any_flag}" "send-keys -M; \
send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M" "if -Ft= '#{pane_in_mode}' 'send-keys -M; \
send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M' 'select-pane -t=; copy-mode -e; \
send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M; send-keys -M'"
bind -n C-Space select-pane -t :.+
bind -n C-] split-window -h
bind -n C-h split-window -v
bind -n C-q kill-pane
~~~

This config file turns off status bars and all other earthly distractions. It
also sets up a few handy shortcuts, and the one shortcut that will change your
life.

I've found these shortcuts to not interfere with other applications I use. One
or two may interfere with corner-use-case Vim, but Vim uses every shortcut
conceivable to mankind, so I'm blameless when it comes to this.

# Keyboard shortcuts

|||
|-|-|
|`Ctrl+]`| Creates a vertical split |
|`Ctrl+h`| Creates a horizontal split |
|`Ctrl+q`| Closes a split |
|`Ctrl+b z`| Maximizes a split |
|`Ctrl+b }`| Rotates splits |
|`Ctrl+b s`| List all active tmux sessions and select any one |
|`Ctrl+b $`| Name current session, if you're into that sort of thing |

And finally, the shortcut that will undeniably change your life...

**drum roll...**

`Ctrl+space` to switch pane focus!

I also set this shortcut up in my text editor of choice (currently, Sublime Text
3). It allows me to effortlessly move the cursor between the left and the right
panes, and has become second nature now. Coupled with Vim controls (in my
editor), it means I rarely have to take my hands off the home row. I know Visual
Studio binds this to Intellisense, but try it out for yourself, and do let me
know in the unlikely event that it does change your life.

# tmux commands

Use these commands on the command-line to control tmux:

|||
|-|-|
|`tmux`| Starts tmux in the current directory. Follow up with `Ctrl+]` or `Ctrl+h` to create panes and start working. |
|`tmux attach`| If tmux is already running, directly open an existing session. Remember `Ctrl+b s` to switch sessions. |
|`tmux detach`| Detaches from the session but keeps it running |
|`tmux kill-server`| Quits tmux. Alternatively `Ctrl+q` repeatedly to exit.|

# Clipboard ergonomics

With a little bit of elbow grease, you can get tmux to automatically copy your
left-mouse-drag-selection to the clipboard. The elbow grease is required because
tmux requires a minimum version I keep forgetting, which is not installed on
some modern Ubuntii by default. They also keep [messing with the config
options](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/754) to do so. Good luck finding
this out. Let me know if you find a handy way to summarize this mess across tmux
versions.

`bind-key -t vi-copy MouseDragEnd1Pane copy-pipe "xclip -in -selection clipboard"`
works on my machine for this. Likely won't work on yours.

In the mean-time, if you want to copy something to clipboard (tested on Ubuntu
terminal only), shift + mouse-drag a selection, right click and then click on
copy.
